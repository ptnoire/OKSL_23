# OKSL_23
The latest iteration of OKSL's website will allow moderators to login, post information and have it displayed on the page using a server that I set up. It will be the main hub for all things OKSL that will lead users to their destination.


The newest iteration of this website will be scraping data from a discord bot that will allow my moderators to make post and have the website auto update. Will come back on the development on the discord bot, the styling to the site is nearly done.
